# Microsoft Teams Integration

The Teams integration allows configuration of notifications for events such as Deploy or Health from Komodor to a Teams channel. Komodor supports different granularity levels, Cluster, Namespace and Service for each notification. The notification type, destination, and granularity can be defined in the Komodor Notifications screen.

##  Configuring Teams Notifications

###  Configuration Steps

1. Open up the Komodor [Notifications Panel](https://app.komodor.com/main/notifications). On this screen you can see all existing notifications or configure new ones.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and decide which type of notification you would like to create, Deployment or Health Change.

## What is Komodor

Komodor is a Kubernetes operations platform for developers, complete with automated playbooks for every K8s resource, and static-prevention monitors that enrich live & historical data with contextual insights to help enforce best practices and stop incidents in their tracks. 
<br /><br />By baking K8s expertise directly into the product, Komodor is accelerating development cycles, reducing MTTR, and empowering dev teams to manage their K8s apps efficiently and independently.


## Agent Install

### Requirements
* Installed kubectl command-line tool.<br />
* Have a kubeconfig file (default location is ~/.kube/config).<br />
* Have an active connection to the desired cluster<br />
* Installed [Helm3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) or [Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)<br />

### Permissions
The Komodor agent uses the native RBAC model of Kubernetes. All the permissions are listed here:

1. [helm](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/k8s-watcher/templates/clusterrole.yaml)
2. [kustomize base](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-charts/blob/master/manifests/base/clusterrole.yaml), [kustomize final](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-charts/blob/master/manifests/overlays/full/logs-reader.cr.yaml)

## Step 1 - Sign up to Komodor

To create your account, [sign up](https://app.komodor.com/#mode=signUp) for Komodor with your email address or by using SSO via your Google, GitHub or Microsoft accounts.

## Step 2 - Installing the Agent

* The main installation method uses Helm 3.0 to install the Komodor Agent on your cluster
* If you aren‚Äôt using Helm, you can install the Agent with [Kustomize](#kustomize-install), or with our guided installation script using Bash [Linux/Mac] or Powershell [Windows]
* You can also install the Agent manually using the Helm command template below


### Guided install
![install comand wizard](./img/Install_wizard.png)
<br /><br />
1. Pick the relevant script: Powershell (Windows) or Bash (Linux/Mac), run it in your shell/terminal and follow the steps in the installation script. <br />
2. Our guided install script will run the following actions for you:<br />

* Make sure you have KubeCTL
* Get the cluster from your current context (If you want to install on a different context - change it and run the command again)
* Set the cluster display name in Komodor using the current context (You can choose to use a custom name if you prefer)
* Verify you have the latest version of Helm
* Run and install the Agent using Helm


### Helm install
![add cluster](./img/install_wizard_helm.png)

1. Pick Helm out of the installation options.
2. The Helm command generates a unique API key and defines the cluster name.
3. Copy the Helm command into your terminal, and run the command.


### Template for manual Helm install
You can also manually build and run the following Helm command:


```bash
helm repo add komodorio https://helm-charts.komodor.io
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install k8s-watcher komodorio/k8s-watcher \
 --set apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE \
 --set watcher.clusterName=CLUSTER_NAME \
 --set watcher.enableAgentTaskExecution=true \
 --set watcher.allowReadingPodLogs=true
```


### Kustomize install
Alternatively you can use the following Kustomize command:
```bash
export KOMOKW_API_KEY= # API KEY Required
export KOMOKW_CLUSTER_NAME= # Cluster name the will be presented in Komodor
kubectl create ns komodor
kubectl apply -n komodor -k https://github.com/komodorio/helm-charts/manifests/overlays/full/?ref=master
```

The API key can be found in the Integration page.

## Step 3 - Integrate additional clusters

1. Go to the Integration page by clicking the Integrations tab on the lefthand navigation menu.

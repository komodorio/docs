# Actions (initial release) 

To allow our users to close the troubleshooting loop through Komodor, weâ€™re adding the ability to perform Actions through the platform.

Using Komodor you can run multiple actions against your resources, including the ability to terminate Pod/s, scale your Deployments, re-trigger your Jobs, revert a deployment and many more to come.

## Prerequisites 
- Agent version 0.1.104
- Required permissions (as more actions will be supported, more permissions will be required) 
```
  - apiGroups:
    - apps
    resources:
    - deployments/scale
    - statefulsets/scale
    verbs:
    - patch
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    resources:
    - pods
    verbs:
    - delete
```
- **Please note:** At this stage, only account **Admins** can see and perform actions against their resources, in the near future we will add the ability to configure granular permissions

## How to opt-in 
### New cluster installation
To install a new cluster with actions enabled just follow the installation process from the Komodor console

### Cluster upgrade
```
helm repo add komodorio https://helm-charts.komodor.io ; helm repo update; helm upgrade --install k8s-watcher komodorio/k8s-watcher --set watcher.actions=true --reuse-values
```

## How to revoke
To disable the usage of Actions using helm, use the following command:
```
helm repo add komodorio https://helm-charts.komodor.io ; helm repo update; helm upgrade --install k8s-watcher komodorio/k8s-watcher --set watcher.actions=false --reuse-values
```

## How does it work?
- User triggers a Manual Action through the Komodor platform 
- A command is registered to the Komodor SaaS
- The Agent running in the cluster fetches the command from the Komodor SaaS (communication is always done from the Agent outside of the cluster) 
- The command is triggered against the Kuberenetes API 
- Kubernetes will now execute the command
- During the entire process you can track the changes/events through a dedicated Event that will be created on the Komodor timeline.

**Please note:** Due to Kubernetes nature, this feature is built in an async way, review the timeline after triggering any action for updates

### Audit
For auditing purposes, Manual Actions events are created on the Komodor timeline

### What type of Actions are supported and where can they be triggered from?
We currently support two main actions:
- Scale service - can be triggered from a Service Timeline page
- Delete Pod - can be triggered from both the Pod inspection page (under Workloads) and the Pods & Logs screen

In the future, we will spread Actions all across the platform to help mitigating on-going issues

## Coming soon / Komodor Actions roadmap
We plan on adding mutliple actions in the near future, here are some of those
- Create/Update/Delete resource (will be supported for all resources)
- Modify requests/limits
- Restart service
- Re-trigger failed Job
- Revert deployment

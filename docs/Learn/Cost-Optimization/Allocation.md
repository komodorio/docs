# Cost Allocation
Kubernetes as a centralized infrastructure is usually used by multiple teams within the organization, making it complex to associate cluster-related costs to workloads, identify potential cost anomalies, etc.

Komodor’s cost allocation page provides clear visibility into your Kubernetes costs,  to easily associate costs to clusters, namespaces, workloads, and services  It provides a high-level understanding of the opportunities for improvement and optimization, and you can use our right-sizing page & reports to dive deeper. 

## When to use Cost Allocation
- If you’d like to keep different teams, departments, or team members responsible and accountable for their unique Kubernetes costs   
- If your Kubernetes costs have significantly increased (trust us, we’ve been there!), but you’re unsure what’s the root cause   

## Cost Allocation Attributes
- **Total Costs:** Overall costs for the scope currently reviewed   
    - Limited permissions or any filters applied for either your Komodor user or this specific page can impact the numbers presented

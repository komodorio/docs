Specify a unique workspace name, add an optional description, and scope (options described below)

## Scoping a Workspace
You can create a workspace both dynamically based on existing configurations such as labels, and namespaces as well as by manually selecting the relevant services.

- Dynamic scope   
Allows for the creation of workspaces with dynamic scope, the user has to select a namespace or a label key:value pair and the workspace scope will consist of Workloads that are either part of the selected namespace or have the specified label across all of your clusters.

    Example usage:  

    - A namespace

    - Label key:value pair

- Manual scope    
Allows manually selecting the relevant Workloads to include in the workspace scope

## Best practices
- It is recommended to limit your workspace scope to up to 100 workloads, surpassing this number could introduce a loading lag while entering the Overview page

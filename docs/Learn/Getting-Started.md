## What is Komodor

Komodor is a Kubernetes operations platform for developers, complete with automated playbooks for every K8s resource, and static-prevention monitors that enrich live & historical data with contextual insights to help enforce best practices and stop incidents in their tracks. 
<br /><br />By baking K8s expertise directly into the product, Komodor is accelerating development cycles, reducing MTTR, and empowering dev teams to manage their K8s apps efficiently and independently.

The komodor agent consists of two main components:
* `Komodor-agent` deployment - responsible for collecting data from the kubernetes API and sending it to the komodor platform.
* `Komodor-agent-daemon` daemonset - responsible for collecting metric data from nodes and pods and sending it to the komodor platform.
